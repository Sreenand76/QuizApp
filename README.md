- **User (Browser):** Accesses the application through a modern web browser.
- **Frontend (React.js + Tailwind CSS):**  
  - Served as a static site (via Vercel).  
  - Communicates with the backend API using HTTPS and includes JWT in requests.
- **Backend API (Spring Boot):**  
  - Exposes RESTful endpoints for quiz management, user authentication, scoring, etc.  
  - Handles role-based access control (admin/user) using JWT tokens.
- **Database (MySQL):**  
  - Stores users, quizzes, questions, scores, categories, and more.
- **Authentication (JWT):**  
  - On login, backend issues JWT, which the frontend stores and attaches to API requests.
